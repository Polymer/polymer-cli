# Changelog

## Unreleased
<!-- Add new, unreleased items here. -->

## v1.5.4 [08-31-2017]
- Upgraded web-component-tester to v6.1.5 to address IE11 issues.

## v1.5.3 [08-31-2017]
- Upgraded web-component-tester to v6.1.4 to address IE11 issues.

## v1.5.2 [08-26-2017]
- Upgraded web-component-tester to v6.1.3 to address yarn installation issues.

## v1.5.1 [08-22-2017]
- Upgraded web-component-tester to v6.1.2.

## v1.5.0 [08-22-2017]
- Fix issue where the `--fragment` flag was being ignored.
- Added support for `polymer test --npm` option.

## v1.4.1 [08-10-2017]
- Fixed the `polymer serve --npm` option.

## v1.4.0 [08-08-2017]
- Upgraded to Polymer Build ^2.0.0 which uses Polymer Bundler ^3.0.0.
- When no specific option is set for Bundler's `rewriteUrlsInTemplates` the CLI attempts to get the version of Polymer for the project using `bower`.  When Polymer 2.x is discovered, `rewriteUrlsInTemplates` is defaulted to `false`.  In case of Polymer 1.x or where version can not be identified, it defaults to `true`.  Any user settings override these defaults.
- Fix issue where negative `extraDependencies` globs were not working.
- test: Add support for WCT `config-file` option.

## v1.3.1 [07-06-2017]
- Fixed [issue #710](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli/issues/710) where the es5 custom elements adapter would not be added when bundling.
- Fixed [issue #767](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli/issues/767) where hyphenated option names for `build` command were effectively ignored.

## v1.3.0 [06-30-2017]
- Added support for optional polymer-project-config provision of bundler options instead of only boolean value for the `bundle` property of build definitions.  See the [Polymer Project Config 3.4.0 release notes](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-project-config/pull/37) for details on new options available in polymer.json.
- Includes Polymer Build fixes to push-manifest generation and others.  See [Polymer Build 1.6.0 release notes](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-build/pull/249).
- Includes Polymer Bundler fixes to shell strategy and others.  See [Polymer Bundler 2.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler/pull/573).

## v1.2.0 [06-12-2017]
- Updated lint rule to `polymer-2` in the `polymer-2-element` template.
- Drop 1.x init templates. Bump `shop` init template to latest version.

## v1.1.0 [05-23-2017]
- Updated dependency on latest polymer-project-config so that bundled presets include prefetch link generation.
- `build` Entrypoints will now be properly cached by generated service workers, and assets will be fetched by service workers using relative URLs to support apps mounted at non-root host paths.
- `build` The `basePath` option no longer adds a prefix to service workers or push manifests. Relative URLs are used instead.

## v1.0.2 [05-19-2017]
- Updates dependencies on latest polymer-build and polymer-bundler to reduce extraneous html tag output when bundling and generating prefetch links.

## v1.0.1 [05-18-2017]
- Update element and application templates to latest stable versions
- Prefetch links are now compatible with bundler and differential serving w/ base tag hrefs in entrypoint documents.

## v1.0.0 [05-16-2017]
- Official 1.0.0 release of the Polymer CLI! ðŸŽ‰
- `build` Support for new `basePath` build config option that remaps paths to assist in serving at non-root paths, such as when doing differential serving of multiple builds from the same host. Affects service worker generation, push manifest generation, and also updates the entrypoint's `<base>` tag if found.
- `build` Building your project will now write a copy of your `polymer.json` to the build directory. This provides a log of the build options used at the time, including expansion of presets.

## v0.18.4 [05-15-2017]
- Updated dependencies to support official `polymer-analyzer` 2.0.0 and `web-components-tester` 6.0.0 releases.

## v0.18.3 [05-12-2017]
- Fix the CLI preset flag.
- Fix an issue where compiling JS would crash in versions of node with native async iterators.
- `bundle` no longer emits any JS or CSS files which have been inlined into bundles.

## v0.18.2 [05-10-2017]

- `build` Support build configuration "presets".
- `build` Performance improvements, including reduction of extraneous insertions of html, head and body tags.
- `bundle` has many bug fixes and support for lazy imports.
- Update polyserve to 0.19.0 which adds HTTP compression and JS compilation for Mobile Safari and Vivaldi browsers.
- Produce much smaller output when compiling many JS files to ES5 by inserting babel helpers only once, at the toplevel entrypoint.

- `init`: Propagate `description` from `init` to application templates in `index.html` meta tag.

- **New Command Aliases**: Commands now support aliases. `polymer install` has been aliased under `polymer i`.

## v0.18.1 [04-25-2017]

- `init` small template fixes.
- `serve` now respects the `entrypoint` configured in `polymer.json`.
- Remove ability to run a locally installed version of the CLI if it exists in the current working directory. This unexpected behavior was never documented but some users could be running an incorrect version of the CLI as a result.
- Update Node.js version pre-run check to match latest supported versions.

## v0.18.0 [04-13-2017]

v0.18.0 contains our latest work to support both Polymer 1.x & 2.0 projects. There are a bunch of big new features included in this update, as well as several breaking changes since the latest version. Here is a quick summary of the major changes for anyone who is updating from our previous `latest`/`v0.17.0` version:

- **New Polymer 2.0 Templates**: `polymer init` has added new Polymer 2.0 templates for starter elements, applications, and our latest Polymer Starter Kit & Shop applications. Run `polymer init` to see the whole list.
- **Updated `lint` Command**: `polymer lint` is now powered by our newest version of [polymer-linter](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-linter). The new linter can show you the exact location of any problems in your code, and is much more configurable. Run `polymer help lint` for more information.
- **Updated `build` Command**: `polymer build` is now powered by our newest version of [polymer-build](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-linter), which provides even more optimizations and features for customizing your build. Run `polymer help build` for more information.
- **New Build Output**: The biggest change to `polymer build` behavior is that it no longer defaults to outputting two, optimized build targets. The new default behavior is to generate a single `/build/default` directory with all configurable optimizations turned off by default. To customize your build(s) and include different optimizations, you can either include CLI flags (like `--js-compile`) or custom polymer.json build configurations. See the latest [polymer.json "builds"](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-json#builds) specification for more information.
- **New `analyze` Command:** Generates a JSON blob of metadata about your element(s). This can be useful to have for tooling and analysis.
- **New `install` Command:** Like `bower install`, but with support for installing "variants" as defined in your `bower.json`. See [the glossary](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/glossary#dependency-variants) for more information.
- Remove Node v4 support: Node v4 is no longer in Active LTS, so as per the [Polymer Tools Node.js Support Policy](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/node-support) the Polymer CLI will not support Node v4 going forward. Please update to Node v6 or later to continue using the latest verisons of Polymer tooling.
