# Changelog

<!--## Unreleased-->

## v0.18.0-pre.15 [03-22-2017]

- `build`: Update automatic `webcomponentsjs` polyfilling to use `custom-elements-es5-adapter.js` instead of broken `webcomponents-es5-loader.js`. Fixes compiled, bundled builds in Chrome. (See [#605](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli/issues/605))

## v0.18.0-pre.14 [03-20-2017]

- The experimental linter has graduated to be the new default. Removed `polymer experimental-lint` command. `polymer lint` now runs [polymer-linter](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-linter). See the README and `polymer lint --help` for more info.

## v0.18.0-pre.13 [03-08-2017]

- When running `polymer build` and compiling JS to ES5, we will also rewrite script includes of `webcomponents-loader.js` to `webcomponents-es5-loader.js`.

## v0.18.0-pre.12 [03-07-2017]

- Add PSK 3.0 (Polymer 2.0 Polymer Starter Kit) template to the init command.
- Automatically include un-optimized `webcomponentsjs` polyfills in builds.
- Update Polymer Analyzer, Polymer Bundler and Polymer Linter dependencies
  - Bundles now include optimizations specified in builds.
  - Much more detailed output of `analyze` command.

## v0.18.0-pre.10 [02-21-2017]

- **New `build` Behavior**: New build options have been added to give you more control over the generated build. These options can be defined in your project's `polymer.json`, or via CLI flags. Run `polymer build --help` to see a list of new supported CLI flags.
  - **Previously default behaviors (minifying JavaScript, generating service workers, etc) are now turned off by default.**
  - Multiple builds can now be defined in your project's `polymer.json`. See [the latest documentation](https://github.com/Polymer/docs/blob/ff74953fa93ad41d659a6f5a14c5f7072368edbd/app/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-json.md#builds) for information on configuring your project build(s).
- `init`: Add new 2.0 polymer element & application templates.
- Update dependencies.
- **New `experimental-lint` command**: configurable with per-project rulesets, either with cli args or in your polymer.json. Will soon replace the `lint` command, for now run it as `polymer experimental-lint`. Specify "polymer-2", "polymer-2-hybrid", or "polymer-1" to customize the lint warnings that you receive. Run `polymer help experimental-lint` for more detail.
